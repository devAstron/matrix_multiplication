# matrix_multiplication
Hello, this program performs matrix multiplication on two matrices of size NxM and MxK.
Steps:
1. Write a function called for_matrix1 that accepts the values of n and m for an NxM matrix from the user,
prompts the user to enter the elements of the NxM matrix,
and returns a numpy array called matrix1;
2. Write a function called for_matrix2 that accepts the values of m and n for an MxN matrix from the user,
prompts the user to enter the elements of the MxN matrix,
and returns a numpy array called matrix2;
3. Write a function called for_multiply that takes two matrices as input,
performs matrix multiplication on the two matrices,
and returns the resulting matrix called result.
We need the numpy library to write this program, of course!!!
